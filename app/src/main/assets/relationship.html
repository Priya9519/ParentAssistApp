		<p>The single most important thing you can do as a parent is to build a loving, trusting, nurturing relationship with your children.  I cannot say this too strongly:  If you fail to meet your children’s emotional needs, nothing else that you do for them matters.</p>

		<p>Relationship is the context in which we live.  Every person, regardless of their age, needs to be loved, and to love others.  When children experience their parents as loving, sensitive to their needs, responsive, and helpful, they will develop a secure attachment to their parents which will allow them to grow, develop, and interact with the world around them in healthy ways.  Having a secure attachment simply means that children learn to trust that their parents will love them and will be there for them no matter what.  Children with a secure attachment are able to easily trust others, and will use an attachment figure as a secure base from which to explore the world (and learn new things).  Children with a secure attachment style feel comfortable learning new things and having new experiences.  They are also comfortable with asking for help when they need it, as they trust that the required assistance will be forthcoming.   Research shows that if a child expects people to be caring and responsive, he or she will project a friendly demeanor to others.  If a child expects people to be cold, uncaring, and untrustworthy, he or she will tend to respond to the world by “either shrinking from it or doing battle with it.” (Geddes, 2003, p. 233; Kennedy &amp; Kennedy, 2007 ).  In other words, meeting your children’s emotional needs allows them to form a bond with you that serves as a base for their development in every other area of their life.  Failure to meet your children’s emotional needs will hamper their development in every area of their life (emotionally, socially, behaviorally, academically, etc.).  There is nothing more important than meeting the emotional needs of your children.</p>
		<p><strong>Here’s how to do it:</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Spend time with your children.</strong> This means spending some time each day giving your children your full and undivided attention.  Babies and toddlers need your time and attention most of the time while they are awake.  School-aged children need at least 30 minutes to an hour of your time and attention every evening of the school week (not including the time you spend with them on homework; watching their sports games, classes, or other structured activities; or getting them ready for bed).  They need more time on the weekends.  Even teens need some of your time and attention every day.  They may not act like they care whether you spend time with them, but they do.  </li>
			<li><strong>Be physically affectionate.</strong> Babies and toddlers have a need to be held.  Older children and adolescents have a need to be hugged.  It’s a physical as well as an emotional need.  Babies who are not held can actually die.  It’s called “failure to thrive.” You don’t have to hold them every minute of the day, but you do have to hold them often.  Similarly, you don’t have to cling to your children and adolescents (and shouldn’t) but you do have to hug them.  Past the age of 8 or 9, they may not want you to hug them in front of their friends, and that’s okay.  Hug them when their friends aren’t looking. </li>
			<li><strong>Play with your children.</strong> Having fun together is very important.  Let yourself be a child again with them.  Do the things they like to do.  Build sand castles; finger paint; do puzzles; play catch; read a book to them every night; go bike riding; play basketball; baseball; climb a tree; or whatever you can comfortably do with them – in short, have fun together.  </li>
			<li><strong>Read to (or with) your children.</strong> Reading to toddlers and younger school-aged children not only meets their emotional need for nurturing, but will also build their vocabulary; help to develop their reading skills; and will associate a positive emotional feeling with reading books.  This will help to create a positive attitude toward learning that will help them a lot in school.  Older children may enjoy reading chapter books with you (they read a page or a chapter, and then you read a page or a chapter).  Teens may enjoy discussing books that you have both read.  If your adolescent expresses an interest in reading a book, buy or borrow two copies – one for you, and one for your child.  When you are both done reading the book, you can talk about what you liked about it; discuss the themes presented, etc.  Or if you yourself have problems reading, you can still ask them what the book is about, what they enjoyed most about the book, and what they enjoyed the least about the book.</li>
			<li><strong>Talk to your children.</strong> Talking to babies and toddlers is important for both their language development and their emotional well-being.  You can tell them what you doing while you are doing it. Not only does this encourage them to talk, but it also increases their vocabulary.  You can also tell them how you are feeling.  For example, “I am happy because we are playing together.  I like to play with you”.  For your children who are older take the time to ask them how their day went, and really listen to the answer.  Listen not only for the content of what they are saying (the factual information) but listen also for the feeling in what they are saying.  Take the time to understand not only what happened but how they feel about it.  Feeling heard and understood can help to lower children’s feelings of stress and anxiety, and can help them to feel loved and supported.</li>
			<li><strong>Help your children solve their problems.</strong> Obviously, with very young children, you will solve their problems for them and consistently doing this is important.  As children get older, your role will be to support them in identifying options for solving the problem, and either helping them solve it (depending on their age and the situation), or encouraging them to take the steps to solve it on their own.  So, for example, if your child comes home saying they have been bullied by another student at school, a younger child may have no idea how to deal with it, and may need you to list some options (talk to the bully; talk to a teacher; talk to the principal, etc.) which the two you can discuss.  He or she will likely need you to go with him or her to speak to an adult at school, or to have the conversation on their behalf.  An adolescent may need your help with brainstorming options, but may prefer to speak to school officials him/herself.</li>
			<li><strong>Respond to their needs.</strong> It goes without saying that children need their physical needs met (food, clothing, shelter, clean water, medical care, etc.).  They also need their emotional needs met, and other needs such as the need for belonging; the need for challenge and personal growth; the need for power; etc.  For example, if they don’t feel a sense of belonging in their peer group because they have no friends, teach them social skills and provide them with opportunities to engage with other children outside of the structured school setting.  Help to meet their need for power by giving them age-appropriate choices (they make the choice, but parents control the range of options).  </li>
			<li><strong>Tell your children that you love them.</strong> This seems obvious, but sometimes parents don’t do this because they think their children already know this.  Isn’t it evident by all the things they do for their children?  The short answer is “no.”  Children and adolescents need to actually hear the words “I love you.”  </li>
			<li><strong>Identify their strengths and celebrate their accomplishments.</strong> Children learn about themselves in part through the feedback they get from others.  So noticing and commenting on their strengths is an important part of building relationship.  It lets them know that you see them in a positive way, and that you believe in them and in the positive things that they are capable of doing.  It builds self-esteem, and makes it easier for children to take the risk of trying to develop new skills.  When they accomplish something (whether that is getting 100% on a spelling test; taking their first steps; mastering a chore; or learning to drive), celebrate the accomplishment.  The celebration doesn’t have to be a huge event.  A “Way to go!” and a high five are often enough.   Recognizing accomplishments reinforces the message that they are capable.</li>
			<li><strong>Act in a loving way toward them.</strong> Greet them with a smile.  Give them a hug.  Ask about their day.  Listen to their problems.  Celebrate their accomplishments.  Make it clear that you enjoy being with them.</li>
			<li><strong>Never give up on them or let them up on themselves.</strong> Give them the courage to keep going even when they make mistakes.  You do not have to like their mistakes, but teach that mistakes are made by everyone. You can teach them to forgive themselves by you forgiving them.</li>
